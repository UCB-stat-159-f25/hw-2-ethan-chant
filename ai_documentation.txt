I have a note book and I pulled the version numbers of the notebook and put it in a yml file everything ran when I used the yml as the new kernel except I got this one error and I double checked and even used the exact scipy version but im still getting this

I see exactly whatâ€™s happening. The error means that your SciPy version doesnâ€™t actually include those window functions where the code expects them.

Why this happens
scipy.signal.tukey was deprecated and moved.

Same with scipy.signal.blackman.
Depending on your version of SciPy, these window functions might now live under scipy.signal.windows instead of directly in scipy.signal.

So when your code does:

signal.tukey(...)
signal.blackman(...)
SciPy raises AttributeError because those functions arenâ€™t in the top-level signal module anymore.

How to fix it
You have two options:

Option 1: Update the code to the modern API
Replace:

signal.tukey(template.size, alpha=1./8)
signal.blackman(template.size)
with:

signal.windows.tukey(template.size, alpha=1./8)
signal.windows.blackman(template.size)
Option 2: Pin an older SciPy version
If the assignment or environment expects the old syntax, install a version before the API change (e.g. scipy==0.19.1 or similar). But this can break other parts of your environment, so itâ€™s less ideal unless required by the course.

Recommended (safe) patch
Update the try/except block like this:

try:
    dwindow = signal.windows.tukey(template.size, alpha=1./8)
except AttributeError:
    dwindow = signal.windows.blackman(template.size)
ðŸ‘‰ Quick check: Run this in your notebook to see whatâ€™s available in your version:

import scipy.signal as signal
dir(signal.windows)
That will confirm that tukey and blackman live under signal.windows in your SciPy.

Do you want me to help you modify your notebook code so it works across both old and new SciPy versions (backward compatible)? That way itâ€™ll run for graders too no matter what version they have.
